# 02901 Advanced Topics in Machine Learning: Computational Tools for Machine Learning in Python

[02901 Advanced Topics in Machine Learning: Computational Tools for Machine Learning in Python](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02901/)

The course consists of five days (Mon-Friday) of lectures and exercises on key topics in machine learning. This years summer school will focus on several different advanced topics within machine learning pertaining to implementing models and analyzing data using machine learning tools in Python. The course (2.5 ects point) is passed by handing in a small report on one of the topics covered in the course. The exercises will cover both theoretical, technical programming and application aspects. It will be up to the students to decide on what aspects to focus on in the report. Specific machine learning application examples are used throughout the entire week.

The summer school took place August 20-24, 2018 at the Section for Cognitive Systems, DTU Compute, Technical University of Denmark.
