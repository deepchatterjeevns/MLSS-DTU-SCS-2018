These are my slides for the Friday morning lecture, "Diffeomorphisms for Dummies & Augmentations for Awesommies". To view the slides, just open the SVG file in your browser (only tested with Firefox, but should work in other browsers as well). Use the arrow keys or your space bar on your keyboard to navigate the slides. The slides can be edited in Inkscape using Sozi.
