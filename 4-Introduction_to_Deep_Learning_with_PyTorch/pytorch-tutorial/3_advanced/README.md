# Credits

This is a remix/a PyTorch course assistent to [Standford's CS224n (winter 2018)](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/index.html).

# Content

These labs are more advanced and time consuming than the previous labs.
It is required that you have a good understanding for statistics, probability, and convex optimization.

The course will follow [Standford's CS224n (winter 2018)](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/index.html), where we have translated the three assignments to PyTorch and iPython Notebook.

Each lecture will consist of reading material and a 1.5 hour video.

We expect that you give a brief summarization of each article and the core content introduced in the video lecture.
